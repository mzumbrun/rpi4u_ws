# development of diff_drive robot
slowly working up to a "big" autonomous diff_drive robot

As of Aug2024 code is in great state of flux. Unwise to use. Ok to look at.

baseline code from Udemy class by Antonio Brandi
I highly recommend taking the class

small_bot -> resembles udemy bumperbot
big_bot -> large bot with Flipsky 6354 bldc motors
